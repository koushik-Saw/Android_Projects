        <p>WS- Women Guardianship, is a freemium service for Bangladeshi people to solve their daily problems.</p>
        <p>The app can locate users current zone & help the user to find the nearest safe zones, like: Religious Institutions, Police Stations, Hospitals, Fire Stations etc. If the user set their predefined safe zones like their office or home zone or relative's zone, then the app will easily help to navigate the user from their current zone to their nearest safe zones.
        </p>
        <p>Even the app will help the user to contact with nearest police stations, hospitals, fire stations etc. during the emergency situation.</p>
        <p>If the user add trusted contact & the contact accept the request, then they will be assumed as family contacts. Then they can easily see their last zone & during emergency they can find their family member's zone.</p>
        <p>This was the basic concept of the WG Project. But now the project will solve more than that.</p>
        <p>In every few weeks the app will have new problem's solution that bother the people of the country. That's how the WS app become The WG Project.</p>
        <p>All people behind The WG Project including our Founder just want one thing from the people of Bangladesh is SUPPORT.</p>
